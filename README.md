# flushway
Welcome to the flushway project. What happens to the wastewater when you press the flush button?
In our web project we tell what happens to the waste water as soon as it leaves the house. We show it's way on a map. From your own home through the sewers to the Waste Water Treatment Plant and then to the Reuss river near Lucerne.

For local development, a .env.local file with the API-Keys is needed. Contact [@seimon-m](https://github.com/seimon-m) for more informations.
